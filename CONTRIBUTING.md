# Contributing

Bash and `git`. No build, no package manager, no dependencies. One command runs everything CI
runs:

```bash
bin/test.sh
```

It finds every `*.test.sh` in the tree rather than listing them, so a new suite is tested by
existing. `shellcheck` is run in CI over every script and is worth having locally.

[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) is the contract behind all of it — read it before changing a
guard, an adapter or the installer, because most of what looks like an odd choice is §-numbered
there with its reason. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) gets an entry under `[Unreleased]` for
anything a consumer would notice on their next pull.

## Inbound contributions are under the MIT licence, certified by a sign-off

Every commit carries a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org)
sign-off:

```bash
git commit -s
```

That adds a `Signed-off-by:` line and is the whole of it — there is no CLA to sign. No copyright is
aggregated anywhere here, so a CLA would buy a signing service to guarantee what
[the licence](LICENSE) already grants. CI checks the line is present on every commit in a pull
request, and exempts authors whose name ends in `[bot]`: the bots that open pull requests here
commit without a sign-off, and a required check they cannot satisfy buys an admin-bypass habit
rather than a stronger guarantee.

## Four things that look like bugs and are deliberate

A pull request that "fixes" one of these needs to argue with the reason, not just the code.

- **A guard whose policy file is absent exits 0, and a guard that is *missing* blocks the commit.**
  Those look inconsistent and are opposites on purpose (ARCHITECTURE §3, §4). An absent policy is a
  repository that did not opt in. An absent guard is a chain that has been broken, and skipping it
  silently is exactly the failure the chain exists to prevent.
- **`bin/adapt` never edits a file the tenant already has** — not even to merge one hook into a
  settings file it could parse. It prints what is missing and stops (§7). A tool that rewrites
  somebody's instruction file is a tool they stop running.
- **The `.gitignore` rules an adapter appends are skipped when the tenant already has any rule
  about that path**, rather than when the line matches exactly. A tenant ignoring `projects/*/*`
  while keeping `projects/*/memory/*.md` tracked loses that memory to a broader pattern appended
  underneath, because the last matching pattern wins.
- **`--no-verify` is documented in the refusal message of every guard.** A control with no bypass
  is a control that gets uninstalled the first time it is wrong at an inconvenient hour. The guards
  are a floor, not a cage; [README.md](README.md#what-this-does-not-catch) says what they are not.

## Two rules that decide most review comments

**One canonical home per fact.** A mechanism is explained once, in the document that owns it, and
linked from everywhere else. A pull request that restates something `ARCHITECTURE.md` already says
will be asked to link instead — two copies drift and one becomes a lie with no signal which.

**Nothing here may name a tenant.** No tenant, machine, account, address or repository
other than this one. `.protocol/tenant` states that as identifier shapes and as the words a tenancy
is described with; your commit is checked against it, and CI runs `guards/tenant-guard.sh
--scan-tree` over the whole tree. If the check refuses something legitimate, the denylist is the
bug — narrow it in the same pull request and say why.

The rule reaches the argument, not only the names. The denylist also carries the handful of words
a tenancy gets described with, so a document explaining a rule by who someone works for is refused
exactly as one naming a repository is. You will find you cannot write those words here even to warn
about them — that is the point, and it is why this paragraph does not name them. State the rule as
a property of the design instead.

That reaches your pull request's own body. [`doctrine/git.md`](doctrine/git.md#a-pull-request-names-the-phase-that-authorized-it)
asks a body to open by declaring the phase of the plan that authorized the work, and a plan path is a
tenant's fact that does not travel here — so a contribution to this repository declares `"plan": null`
and `"phase": null` with a `"reason"`, which is the form that section provides for work no plan
authorized. [The template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) is pre-filled that way.

## Adding or changing a rule in `doctrine/`

[INDUCTION.md](INDUCTION.md) is the whole of what that costs, and it is the part of this repository
most likely to turn a pull request down. The short form: name the principle the rule instantiates,
in the strongest form the wider field states it, and cite the specific prior work it is named from —
author, title, year, in the form the field recognizes it by, because a practice area is not a
citation; say where this repository departs from that form and why; show the particular that induced
it and then leave the particular behind; and say what holds the rule — a guard, a review, or nothing
but the reader, which is the ordinary answer.

The citation is printed where the rule is stated: on a `Named:` line under the document's opening
line, which also links to the lineage entry, and in [README.md](README.md)'s table of the doctrine.
A new document also needs its row in INDUCTION.md's register, which carries the full lineage and the
departure, and an entry in [LINEAGE.md](LINEAGE.md) for each work it is named from — that work's own
scope, and what its own field says against it, or the claim in as many words that no serious
objection was found. `bin/induction.test.sh` fails the build without any of the four. A rule that
cannot get through is not thereby wrong: it is a mechanism, a measurement, or a sentence belonging
to a document that already exists, and all three have somewhere else to go.

## Showing that a rule here is wrong

This is a contribution, and it is the one this repository is least able to produce for itself.
[INDUCTION.md](INDUCTION.md#why-the-name-is-the-load-bearing-condition) already takes that position
for one claim: a document saying no prior work was found is falsifiable, any reader holding a
citation can refute it, and such a refutation is "a contribution rather than an embarrassment". The
same offer stands against the rules themselves. The fourth admission condition lets a rule in only
if its breach is observable and cheap to observe, which is a promise made to a reader who has not
been found yet — and a rule nothing can show failing is the shape that condition exists to refuse.

What it takes is a particular rather than an argument: the rule, what it cost, and what caught it. A
case that a rule is unwise is a disagreement about preference, and
[README.md](README.md#a-doctrine-only-holds-if-it-travels) already says what to do with one — fork
it, and keep the installer. An issue is enough; no pull request is expected. If the particular is a
tenant's, describe it at the shape and file it where the section below says, which costs this
repository nothing: what it records is the general failure and never the afternoon.

It lands in [REFUTATION.md](REFUTATION.md), credited to whoever found it, by whatever name they
give. What then happens to the rule is a separate judgement — narrowed, kept with the cost recorded,
or removed — and the entry stands whichever it is. A page of them is the best evidence this
repository can offer about itself; an empty one is evidence only that nobody has looked.

## Adding an adapter for another AI coding agent

Most of the work is finding out which environment variable relocates that agent's configuration
directory, and whether it already reads `AGENTS.md` from the working directory — several do, and
for those the adapter is nearly empty. Then write the three files
[`adapters/README.md`](adapters/README.md) specifies and add nothing to `bin/adapt`: it discovers
the directory. Bring a `*.test.sh` if the adapter does anything a shell can assert.

## Style

- No comment explaining *what* code does. A comment earns its place by explaining a non-obvious
  *why* — a constraint, an invariant, a workaround. Most of the comments here are that.
- New or changed behaviour arrives with the test that pins it, in the same pull request. A test
  that passes whether or not the property holds is not a test; write it red first where you can.
- No new dependencies. The value of a guard chain is partly that it is small enough to audit in
  one sitting, and it has to run on a machine where installing things is somebody else's decision.
- Prose in `doctrine/` is held to `doctrine/clean-code.md`, which applies to documents for the same
  reason it applies to functions: a bloated or duplicated document is paid for by every reader.

## Reporting a defect you found inside a tenant

If you hit it while using this protocol in a tenant's own repository, file it **there** rather than
here — [`doctrine/tenancy.md`](doctrine/tenancy.md#reporting-a-defect-in-the-shared-protocol) is the
reason, and it is the same reason as the rule two sections up. A report written in that repository
is judged by that repository's denylist before it is published; a pull request opened here is
judged by nothing that knows what that tenant's material looks like, and a diff carries more than
the lines it changes.

So a pull request that arrives that way is closed in favour of an issue filed where it belongs, and
the fix is then written here, stated as the general property rather than as the case that found it.
That restatement is not a formality: a fix that can only be explained by naming the tenant that
found it is one this repository could not have carried.

## Reporting a security issue instead of filing a pull request

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — vulnerabilities go through GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting, not a public issue or pull request, until triaged.
