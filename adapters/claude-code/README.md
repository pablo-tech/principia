# Claude Code

**Configuration directory:** `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — it relocates the whole of it, credentials
included, and two sessions running with different values do not interfere. That is what makes one
machine able to serve two tenants.

Installs into the tenant:

- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — a symlink per doctrine file. Claude Code follows symlinked skills.
- `commands/<name>.md` — a symlink per command in [`commands/`](commands). The layout is flat where
  the skills one is nested, so the link target is one level shallower.
- `CLAUDE.md` — a pointer to `AGENTS.md`, written only if the tenant has none.
- `.gitignore` lines for the agent's own runtime state. The tenant directory *is* the configuration
  directory, so `projects/`, `sessions/`, `.credentials.json` and the rest are written into the
  repository. Two of them are disclosing rather than merely noisy: `projects/` holds full session
  transcripts — every file read and every command run — which makes it the most disclosing thing in
  the tree and the first thing ignored, and `skills/synced/` is the account's copy of the bundled
  skills, arriving in a directory named `<account-id>_<org-id>`. The rule is `/skills/synced/`, not
  `/skills/`, because the skills above are tracked.
- `settings.json` — the hooks below, written only if the tenant has none. Where one exists the
  adapter names [`settings-fragment.json`](settings-fragment.json) and stops: merging into a file
  someone wrote is editing it, which no adapter does. It is ignored as well, because the agent
  writes into it at runtime — a theme chosen in a session lands there, and a personal preference is
  not a change to a shared repository. A tenant that *tracks* the file has answered that question
  for itself and gets no such rule.

Check it worked:

```
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<tenant> claude
/skills            # the doctrine names, and nothing belonging to another tenant
```

## The hooks are convenience, not control

`command-guards.sh` is a `PreToolUse` hook for `Bash`: it reads the command, asks each guard in
`command-guards/` in turn, and the first with an opinion decides. The three are
[`dangerous-flags.sh`](command-guards/dangerous-flags.sh) (`--no-verify`, `--amend`, `--force`, and
a `core.hooksPath` pointed away from `.githooks` — every way of turning the commit-time chain off),
[`push.sh`](command-guards/push.sh) (a push straight to the protected branch, a remote-ref
deletion, `--all`, `--mirror`) and [`cherry-pick.sh`](command-guards/cherry-pick.sh) (a pick landing
on it). Each is one rule of [`doctrine/git.md`](../../doctrine/git.md), and the dispatcher fails
closed — a guard that is missing, unexecutable or unreadable denies rather than approves.

Which branch is protected is the tenant's, not the protocol's: `PROTOCOL_PROTECTED_BRANCH`, `main`
by default ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) §6). The dispatcher resolves the name once
and passes it to each guard, so no guard carries a branch name of its own.

`turn-cost.sh` is a `Stop` hook reporting what the turn cost. Its token counts are read from the
transcript; its **dollar figures are a vendor's published list prices, hard-coded in the jq**, so
they are the one thing here that silently goes stale. Re-check them before trusting a figure.

It also **appends one line per turn** to `$PROTOCOL_WORK_LOG`, defaulting to
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/warp/work-log.jsonl` (`~/.local/state/warp/work-log.jsonl`) — a JSON object
carrying `kind`, `at`, `session`, `requests`, `tokens` and `context_max`, and **no dollar figure**,
for the reason above: the measurement is tokens, money is a view over them computed from prices that
are current when the report is written. A figure printed once and discarded can answer what a turn
cost and can never answer whether it is getting worse, which is the whole argument for keeping it.

Setting `PROTOCOL_WORK_LOG` empty turns the append off. The log is append-only, never rotated here,
and nothing in this repository reads it back — it exists for whatever reports on a tenant's own
work, and a tenant that wants none of it sets the variable empty in its own settings.

None of this is the boundary. A hook stops one command in one tool and says nothing about a diff
written by another agent, by hand or by an IDE — see [`doctrine/tenancy.md`](../../doctrine/tenancy.md).
The pre-commit guards are what bind, because they judge the diff rather than the typist.

## What a tenant adds for itself

The chain deliberately carries no rule that is a **list of repositories** — which merges publish a
package, which owners exist, which clone is which. Those are tenant facts, and a protocol that
shipped one would be shipping one tenant's context. A tenant that wants them registers its own
`PreToolUse` hook beside this one; the harness runs every matching hook and takes the first refusal,
so the two chains compose without either knowing about the other.
