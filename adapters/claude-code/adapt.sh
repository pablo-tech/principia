# The tenant directory IS the configuration directory, so the agent writes its runtime state into
# the repository. `projects/` is the one that matters most: it holds full session transcripts, which
# carry every file read and every command run — the most disclosing artifact this design has to keep
# out of a commit. `skills/synced/` is the second of that kind rather than mere noise: it is the
# account's copy of the skills the service bundles, and the directory it arrives in is named
# `<account-id>_<org-id>`. Not `/skills/`, which is where this adapter puts tracked symlinks.
#
# The rest is state an agent rewrites as it runs — caches, fetch markers, a plan-mode scratch
# directory. `/plans/` is ignored although doctrine/planning.md files plans in the context
# repository: they are filed there deliberately, under `planning/`, and a draft the harness wrote is
# not that. Ignored before anything else is installed, so a first run cannot stage any of them.
#
# settings.json is the agent's own file: written per machine from the fragment below, and written
# *into* at runtime — a theme chosen in a session lands there, so a personal preference arrives as a
# diff in a file every machine shares. Machine state, so ignored — unless the tenant tracks it,
# which is that tenant saying it shares one. An adapter may create, never edit.
