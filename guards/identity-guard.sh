# Refuse to COMMIT as an identity this repository does not claim.
#
# Which name and address a commit is made as is machine configuration, not repository
# configuration. A fresh clone carries none of its own, so it is committed to by whoever the
# machine was set up as — and git says nothing about it. The header is written, it is permanent,
# and it is found, if it is found at all, by someone reading `git log` long afterwards. It is also
# the one part of a commit that names a person rather than the work, which is what makes it the
# part that must not travel from one tenant into another's history.
#
# `.protocol/identity` lists the identities this repository's commits may be made as — extended
# regular expressions, one per line — matched case-insensitively against `Name <email>`, for the
# author and for the committer. A repository carrying no such file falls back to the list of the
# tenant it is worked on under, if local git configuration names one (`principia.tenant`, see
# policy.sh) — because a repository worked on under a tenant is deliberately not a tenant and so has
# no `.protocol/` of its own to state this in. A repository that carries the file is judged by it
# alone, empty or not: carrying it is how a repository opts in, and an empty one claims nobody.
#
#   --scan-history [<range>]   apply the rules to the commits in <range> (default: HEAD) instead of
#                              to the commit being made, so a header that reached the branch past
#                              the hook is found on the next run rather than never.

# Bypass, if you genuinely mean it: git commit --no-verify
