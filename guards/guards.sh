# added in one place and every repo picks it up without a commit each. Do not copy a guard's logic
# into a repo — that is the drift this indirection exists to prevent.

# Each guard exits non-zero to block the commit and is expected to explain itself. A guard whose
# policy file the repo does not carry exits 0, so the chain is safe to point at any checkout.
