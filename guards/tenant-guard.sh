# Refuse to COMMIT one tenant's material into another tenant's repository.
#
# One person works for several tenants through the same tools, often on the same machine, in the
# same hour. No AI coding tool can tell which tenant a diff belongs to, and a rule written into one
# tool's config says nothing about a diff produced by another tool, by an editor, or by hand. The
# commit is the one boundary every route passes through.
#
# `.protocol/tenant` lists the terms belonging to the OTHER tenants — as extended regular
# expressions, one per line — and any staged path or staged content matching one is refused. A repo
# without that file declares no tenancy and is not policed.
#
#   --scan-tree   apply the rules to every tracked file on disk instead of the staged set, so an
#                 audit reads the terms from the repo rather than from a doc that then drifts.
#
# Bypass, if you genuinely mean it: git commit --no-verify
